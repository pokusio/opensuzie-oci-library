# Please follow the general troubleshooting steps first:

- [ ] write a little shell script showing exactly How you built the image ?
- [ ] Can you tell on which version of this repository you ran your test ? If not, modify your script adding a `git checkout` command. Always checkout either the last commit on `develop`, to get edges versions, `master` to get hotfixes, or [any exiting release](https://github.com/SUSE/Portus/releases)

- [ ] Write you little script in this issue :

```bash
# write the line of your little script here (don't forget the shebang)
```

- [ ] write here the output you got on your machine :

```bash
# write the line of your little script here (don't forget the shebang)
```

- [ ] : Check this checkbox if you are asking for an enhancement (this is not a bug)
